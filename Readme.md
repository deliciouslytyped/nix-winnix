Shaving yaks so you don't have to.

Docs pending substance. This is an experimental project / repository. âš 

Usage: `nix-build shell.nix; ./result/bin/mounter`

We provide no guarantees about any binaries references in the scripts.

Help wanted:
  - a safe way to do the writable overlay mounts without root
  - composing wine "layers" (not the layers folder, but rather composing multiple applications)
  - installer tooling
    - make it possible to use UniExtract2 in the build process
  - anything else
